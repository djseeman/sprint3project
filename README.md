Project Questions:

Part 1:

1.	Copiers in the East and West were the biggest profit makers. Tables in the South and East Regions were the biggest losses.
2.	Cubify Cubex 3D printer in the East region, GBC Docubind P400 in the Central region, and Cubify Cubex 3D printer in the South region were a few of the biggest profit losses.
3.	Copiers, Phones, and Accessories were the top product subcategories. Tables, bookcases, and supplies had the biggest profit loss.

Part 2:

1.	The three best state and month combinations are Vermont in November, Indiana in October, and Missouri in October. Based on the 1/5 advertising spend rule, I would be willing to pay around $100 on advertising in each of these states during these months.
